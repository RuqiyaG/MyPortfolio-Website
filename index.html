       <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p id="p1">My name is Ruqiya and I am 19 years old, born and raised in England. I come from a Somali background to immigrant parents and currently studying at Goldsmiths University of London pursuing a BSC in Creative Computing. Going through education I didnt really know what I wanted to do and doing A-levels made me even more conflicted but eventually I landed on Creative Computing as it had the perfect blend of the world of computing and creative. Outside of University I am currently completing additional HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python classes this is to help gain more knowledge and understanding and practise my skills. I hope to move onto more advanced sectios of CSS, JavaScript and Python such as Bootstrap, React, SQL etc.</p>

       <p id="p2">Several skills I have learnt is understanding basic user design and experience principles, I have been introduced to platforms like Figma and wireframing which have helped massively in envisioning a website and what components are needed to suit or impact a user. I have also learnt how to assemble a website using HTML which provides the basic framework of any website and how CSS is designed to style a webpage and only functions alongside an existing HTML file. Also how JavaScript is used to provide interactivity and provide seamless transitions</p>
       <p id="p3">As a beginner I still have a long way to go and to improve my skills, if interested take a look around and insight/feedback will be helpful.</p>
